        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML provides the foundational structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, such as the character set and default view.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user, such as presented text and images.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML tags are vital - they provide the meaning of the content contained and how they should be sectioned on the page.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS - cascading style sheet - defines how content is presented, i.e. aesthetics and formatting. </li>
          <li><b>Inline CSS</b> styles a particular page element through specific HTML tags.</li>
            <ul><li>This is useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexible as it is changing individual elements.</li></ul>
          <li><b>Internal Style Sheets</b> contain CSS rules inside the head section.</li>
            <ul><li>Changes here apply to all tagged elements <b>on the same page</b>.</li></ul>
          <li><b>External Style Sheets</b> are preferred and most common, where a separate file is linked in the head section.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This is emblematic of "separation of concerns" [SoC], or abstracting the program into distinct sections which each address a separate concern or detail. </li>
            </ul>
          <li>Examples on this page:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Each of these sections features a card class selector in the HTML, which corresponds to the code applied to the same class</li>
              <li>In the external style sheet, one can see how sections are grouped together and changed to cut down on repetitive code i.e. the header and footer.</li>
            </ul>

        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: commit all files in working branch to stage, -A denotes all</li>
          <li>git commit -m "put message here": commits to git repo with a message, keep it short and descriptive</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>JS provides interactivity - clicking buttons, filling out a form, providing some sort of feedback to the user's input.</li>
            <li>JS is linked to the HTML file in the body under the footer, as opposed to in the head for the CSS</li>
            <li>Control Flow: <b>Order matters</b> so keep operations in mind - i.e. the DevTools console can't log variables before the variables are logged.</li>
